# APE-ASI
The Android App for the Parents Association at Al-Akhawayn School of Ifrane.

## About this Project:

This repository contains my first ever Android project, which I developed as part of the Software Engineering course at AUI. This project holds a special place in my journey as a developer because it marked my introduction to the world of Android app development.
This project wasn't perfect. It had its flaws, but it was the starting point of my Android development journey. To build this project, I relied on native Java with the help of some external dependencies. Being my first project, the app was very slow and lacked good design and structure. However, despite its imperfections, it provided me with invaluable insights into app architecture and the Android ecosystem. After I had worked on this project, I delved deeper into the Android world, eventually transitioning to Kotlin and exploring modern UI development with Jetpack Compose.
